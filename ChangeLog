Version 0.21
* Bot rework is starting -- GSON library is now being used
* Academy is now being accessed by the bot on the first run through. This was done because there wasn't any way to figure out if booty was researched without captain. This also means if you research booty without captain, you have to restart the bot for it to take effect.
* Farming values now work with decimals! Didn't think I'd see a world with 3.5 speed, but there is one!
* Farming has been reworked for captain-less farming!
    * Farming villages should now farm all the resources that they can
    * No more removing farming villages that don't belong to the town
* A new timer for building Troops has been added. If you want the bot to work as before, then have the same values for the bot and troop timers
* Any building that is built by the bot will now be finished automatically if there's less than 5 minutes.
* Farming for other times outside of 5 or 10 minutes is now fixed.

Version 0.20
* Work began on automatic research.
* Fixed a bug that caused the current city to not be the same if you left the queue panel
* The bot will now rush lumber camp 15 and silver mine 10 so that you can build docks faster. Before, you'd have to wait until the town was almost fully built.
* Fixed the bug where you'd have to restart after loading a template
* Backend changes. Working on changing over to JavaFX!
* Bot will now restart if it encounters an error!


Version 0.19
* Templates will now automatically load/save without you having to change the tab.
* You can now farm without captain!
* Town templates have been added!
* Lots of tiny bugs have been patched such as towns not loading as fast as they should have!
* Should now support Linux/Mac systems with loading and saving images and the bot files
* Zooming has been added!
    *Zoom in with control and +
    *Zoom out with control and -
    *Reset zoom with control and 0



Version 0.18
* The town you currently have selected in the queue tab will now automatically update without you changing towns
* Farming tab has been updated to allow all city editing and single city editing.

Version 0.17
* Reworked the user interface! However, almost no testing. I've backed up the previous version just in case.
* Bot pausing actually works while the bot isn't running (keeps the timer stable)
* Added a logging system. Doesn't completely remove the .bat file (still have some error catching to do!)
* Lots of fun awesome backend changes! Wooo. Nothing really added for normal users except minor inconvenience


Version 0.16 - fix
* Building queue no longer stops building after it hits max queue
* Bot will now only demand when mood is set to 100.

Version 0.16
* Bot should now skip the town if there's a conqueror!
* Bot can now read all towns, including the ones without farming villages!

Version 0.15
* Bot will now pause if the server doesn't send a response
* Bot will now pause if all buildings aren't found
* Updated so the bot now finds all the buildings

Version 0.14 - fix
* Login is fixed... again

Version 0.14
* Login system has been updated and fixed! I had to learn some Angular JS to figure this one out!
* Added a delay between requests. Before it was perfect. It's a bit slower now, but it's more human-like
* Fixed farming. Some people were banned by other bots because they're unstable! Mine will stop the second anything goes wrong.
* Constructing buildings now comes before culture checking for culture events.
* Culture now checks to see if it can even be done before attempting.
* Constructing buildings now checks to see if there's any reason to load the senate (there's a random chance of force updating)
* Constructing barrack units now checks to see if there's any reason to load the barracks (there's a random chance of force updating)
* Constructing dock units now checks to see if there's any reason to load the docks (there's a random chance of force updating)
* You can now pause the bot!

Version 0.13
* New login system broke the current one. I'll have to figure it out later. Finals start this week!
* Updating the logging system so that it's centralized. Timestamps everywhere! (also easily to add to GUI later on)
* Queue will now remember your previously selected town

Version 0.12
* Now removes cities that are no longer in your possession
* Added support for adding GRC directly from their website!
* Added support for reading converted reports in alliance forums by default.
