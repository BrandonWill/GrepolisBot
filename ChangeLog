Version 0.19
* In development still...
* Should now support Linux/Mac systems with loading and saving images and the bot files



Version 0.18
* The town you currently have selected in the queue tab will now automatically update without you changing towns
* Farming tab has been updated to allow all city editing and single city editing.

Version 0.17
* Reworked the user interface! However, almost no testing. I've backed up the previous version just in case.
* Bot pausing actually works while the bot isn't running (keeps the timer stable)
* Added a logging system. Doesn't completely remove the .bat file (still have some error catching to do!)
* Lots of fun awesome backend changes! Wooo. Nothing really added for normal users except minor inconvenience


Version 0.16 - fix
* Building queue no longer stops building after it hits max queue
* Bot will now only demand when mood is set to 100.

Version 0.16
* Bot should now skip the town if there's a conqueror!
* Bot can now read all towns, including the ones without farming villages!

Version 0.15
* Bot will now pause if the server doesn't send a response
* Bot will now pause if all buildings aren't found
* Updated so the bot now finds all the buildings

Version 0.14 - fix
* Login is fixed... again

Version 0.14
* Login system has been updated and fixed! I had to learn some Angular JS to figure this one out!
* Added a delay between requests. Before it was perfect. It's a bit slower now, but it's more human-like
* Fixed farming. Some people were banned by other bots because they're unstable! Mine will stop the second anything goes wrong.
* Constructing buildings now comes before culture checking for culture events.
* Culture now checks to see if it can even be done before attempting.
* Constructing buildings now checks to see if there's any reason to load the senate (there's a random chance of force updating)
* Constructing barrack units now checks to see if there's any reason to load the barracks (there's a random chance of force updating)
* Constructing dock units now checks to see if there's any reason to load the docks (there's a random chance of force updating)
* You can now pause the bot!

Version 0.13
* New login system broke the current one. I'll have to figure it out later. Finals start this week!
* Updating the logging system so that it's centralized. Timestamps everywhere! (also easily to add to GUI later on)
* Queue will now remember your previously selected town

Version 0.12
* Now removes cities that are no longer in your possession
* Added support for adding GRC directly from their website!
* Added support for reading converted reports in alliance forums by default.
